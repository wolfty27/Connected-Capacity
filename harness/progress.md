# CC 2.1 Harness Progress

## Initial Harness Setup – 2025-11-29

- Created `feature_list.json` with 8 core CC2.1 features.
- Added `session_log.md` for tracking incremental agent progress.
- Added `progress.md` for summarizing completed/in-progress items.
- Next Claude Code sessions must:
  1. Read `feature_list.json` + `progress.md`
  2. Pick 1–2 features to implement
  3. Update status fields + logs
  4. Commit cleanly
