  The ADL CAP identifies persons with ADL deficits who may benefit from
  restorative care, rehabilitation services, or personal support services.
  Two trigger levels:
  - IMPROVE: ADL deficits with potential for improvement
  - FACILITATE: ADL deficits requiring maintenance/support focus

triggers:
  - level: IMPROVE
