Architectural Specification for the Ontario Personal Support Algorithm, MAPLe, RUG-III HC, and interRAI CAPs: Comprehensive Data Structures and Logic Gates for AI Model Training
1. Executive Summary and System Architecture
This report serves as the definitive technical specification for the development and training of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model designed to automate, optimize, and audit the allocation of home care resources within the Ontario health framework. The primary objective is to synthesize the "Bundle Components" dataset 1 with the theoretical and operational logic of the Method for Assigning Priority Levels (MAPLe), Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-III HC), and interRAI Clinical Assessment Protocols (CAPs).
The scope of this document is exhaustive. It does not merely list the data elements but provides a deep structural analysis of the logic gates, operational cost drivers, and funding source constraints that the AI model must internalize to replicate expert human decision-making. The "Bundle Components" file acts as the foundational ontology—the "output layer" of the neural network—defining the menu of services (e.g., COST-NUR, COST-PSW, COST-RPM) available for allocation. The AI’s task is to map patient acuity inputs (derived from interRAI assessments) to these specific service outputs while adhering to the rigid constraints of funding schedules (Schedule 3 vs. Bundle RFS) and scope-of-practice regulations.
To achieve a training-ready state, this report deconstructs the service catalog into its constituent atoms, defining the specific feature engineering requirements for Clinical Services, Personal Support, Safety Technologies, and Logistical Support. It establishes the "Ground Truth" logic for the Ontario Personal Support Algorithm (PSA), articulating how time-based tasks (e.g., bathing) and frequency-based interventions (e.g., nursing visits) must be calculated, weighted, and prioritized.
1.1 The AI Modeling Objective: From Assessment to Allocation
The core challenge in training this AI model is the translation of unstructured or semi-structured clinical needs into precise financial and operational codes. The system provided in 1 is not a flat list; it is a hierarchical decision matrix.
* Level 1: Clinical Eligibility (The "Why"): Determined by MAPLe and CAPs.
* Level 2: Service Selection (The "What"): Mapped to "Discipline" and "Internal Code" (e.g., COST-PT).
* Level 3: Operational Quantities (The "How Much"): Defined by "Operational Cost Driver" (e.g., Hourly Labour vs. Per Visit Rate).
* Level 4: Budgetary Assignment (The "Who Pays"): Controlled by "Source" (e.g., Sched 3 vs. Bundle RFS).
The AI model must be trained as a multi-stage classifier and regressor. The first stage classifies the need (Boolean presence of COST-NUR), the second stage predicts the volume (Regression of hours/visits), and the third stage optimizes the funding source (Classification of Sched 3 vs Bundle RFS).
1.2 Data Source Ontology
The analysis is grounded in the BundleComponents.csv artifact 1, which provides the authorized lexicon for the system. This dataset contains critical metadata that dictates the behavior of the allocation algorithm.

2. Clinical Services Architecture: Logic Rules and Data Tables
The "Clinical Services" category represents the highest acuity interventions. In the context of the RUG-III HC classification system, these services are the primary drivers for the "Special Rehabilitation" and "Clinically Complex" groups. The AI must be trained to recognize that while these services share a category, their logic rules differ fundamentally based on their "Operational Cost Driver".1
2.1 Nursing (RN/RPN): The COST-NUR Algorithm
The Nursing discipline is the most complex entity in the dataset due to its versatility. The COST-NUR code covers four distinct clinical vectors: Wound Care, Infusion, Palliative, and Medication Management.1 The AI cannot treat COST-NUR as a monolith; it must identify the sub-type to predict the correct frequency and duration.
2.1.1 Wound Care Logic Sub-System
* Intervention Data: "Wound Care: Surgical, pressure ulcers, negative pressure therapy".1
* Cost Driver: "Hourly Labour or Per Visit Rate".1
* AI Training Logic:
The duality of the cost driver ("Hourly" OR "Per Visit") introduces a critical decision node. The AI must decide the billing mode based on procedure complexity.
   * Scenario A (Simple): Simple dressing change $\rightarrow$ Predict "Per Visit Rate" (Fixed Cost).
   * Scenario B (Complex): Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (VAC) or multiple site debridement $\rightarrow$ Predict "Hourly Labour" (Variable Cost).
   * interRAI CAP Integration:
   * Trigger: Skin Integrity CAP.
   * Data Features: The AI requires inputs from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) items regarding Skin (M1-M6), including Ulcer Stage (1-4), Presence of Open Lesions, and Foot Problems.
   * Logic Rule: IF Skin_Ulcer_Stage $\ge$ 2 OR Surgical_Wound == PRESENT, THEN COST-NUR probability = 1.0.
2.1.2 Infusion Therapy Logic Sub-System
   * Intervention Data: "Infusion: IV therapy, CVAD maintenance, hypodermoclysis".1
   * Cost Driver: "Hourly Labour or Per Visit Rate".1
   * RUG-III HC Logic:
The presence of IV therapy places the patient in the Clinically Complex RUG group. This is a "hierarchical trump" variable; its presence overrides lower-acuity classifications.
   * Training Constraint:
Hypodermoclysis (subcutaneous hydration) is a specific geriatric intervention often used to prevent hospital admission for dehydration. The AI must link the Dehydration CAP to this specific COST-NUR sub-type.
      * Logic Gate: IF Dehydration_Risk == HIGH AND Swallowing_Difficulty == PRESENT, THEN Recommend Hypodermoclysis (COST-NUR).
2.1.3 Palliative Care Logic Sub-System
      * Intervention Data: "Palliative: Pain/symptom management, end-of-life care".1
      * Source: "Sched 3 (Nursing)".1
      * MAPLe Connection:
Palliative status is a direct driver of a Very High MAPLe score. The "Palliative" designation often bypasses standard resource caps.
      * AI Contextual Insight:
The inclusion of "Pain management" implies a need for frequent reassessment. The AI should model a "decay curve" for visit frequency—high frequency initially for stabilization, tapering off, then spiking again at the terminal phase.
2.1.4 Medication Management Logic Sub-System
         * Intervention Data: "Meds: Administration (injection, oral), reconciliation".1
         * Logic Rule (The Delegation Gate):
This row interacts directly with the "Delegated Acts" row under Personal Care.1 This is the most significant cost-optimization opportunity in the algorithm.
            * Optimization Rule:
            1. Assess Client Need: "Insulin Injection".
            2. Check Resource: Is COST-NUR required? (Yes, initially).
            3. Check Delegation Eligibility: Is patient stable? Is a PSW available?
            4. AI Decision: IF Stable == TRUE, THEN Convert COST-NUR (High Cost) $\rightarrow$ COST-PSW (Lower Cost, Delegated Act).
            * Exception: "Reconciliation" (checking the list of meds) is strictly a licensed act and cannot be delegated. The AI must parse the keyword "Reconciliation" to enforcing the COST-NUR lock.
2.2 Physiotherapy (PT): The COST-PT Algorithm
            * Intervention Data: "Mobility: Gait training, fall prevention... Chest PT... Modalities".1
            * Cost Driver: "Per Visit Rate".1
            * Internal Code: COST-PT.
2.2.1 The "Chest PT" Distinction
The dataset explicitly lists "Chest PT: Postural drainage, suctioning".1 This is clinically distinct from "Gait training."
            * RUG-III HC Implication: Chest PT is a respiratory intervention that can classify a patient into Special Care (if frequency is high) or Clinically Complex.
            * AI Training Requirement: The NLP module must distinguish "Physio for walking" (Rehab/Mobility) from "Physio for breathing" (Chest PT).
            * Data Trigger: COPD diagnosis, Cystic Fibrosis, Pneumonia history.
            * Logic: IF Diagnosis $\in$ {Respiratory_Conditions} AND Dyspnea_Scale $\ge$ 2, THEN COST-PT (Chest PT) Priority = HIGH.
2.2.2 Fall Prevention Logic
            * Trigger: Falls CAP.
            * Logic: IF Fall_History > 0 OR Unsteady_Gait == PRESENT, THEN Allocate COST-PT (Gait Training).
            * Integration: This service often pairs with COST-OT (Safety Assessment) and COST-PERS (Lifeline). The AI should suggest a "Fall Prevention Bundle" comprising all three.
2.3 Occupational Therapy (OT): The COST-OT Algorithm
            * Intervention Data: "ADL Training: Feeding, dressing, bathing retraining... Safety... Equipment".1
            * Cost Driver: "Per Visit Rate".1
2.3.1 The "Retraining" vs. "Doing" Gate
The most critical logic rule for the Ontario Personal Support Algorithm is the distinction between rehabilitative care (OT) and supportive care (PSW).
            * The Logic Gate:
            * IF Functional_Potential_CAP indicates "Improvement Possible", THEN Allocate COST-OT (Retraining).
            * IF Functional_Potential_CAP indicates "No Improvement Expected", THEN Allocate COST-PSW (Maintenance/Doing for).
            * Equipment Prescription (ADP):
The mention of "Equipment prescription (ADP)" 1 refers to the Assistive Devices Program. The AI must learn that COST-OT is the gateway to accessing ADP funding. An allocation of COST-OT is required before a patient can receive a walker or wheelchair.
2.4 Respiratory Therapy (RT): The COST-RT Algorithm
               * Intervention Data: "Airway: Tracheostomy care, deep suctioning, ventilator management".1
               * Cost Driver: "Per Visit Rate".1
               * Source: "Sched 3 (RT)".1
This is a binary risk category. Patients needing COST-RT have zero tolerance for service failure.
               * AI Logic Rule: IF Tracheostomy == PRESENT OR Ventilator == PRESENT, THEN COST-RT is MANDATORY.
               * Constraint: Unlike COST-PT or COST-OT which can be "waitlisted," COST-RT addresses immediate airway risks. The AI priority weight for this code must be set to Maximum (1.0).
2.5 Social Work (SW): The COST-SW Algorithm
               * Intervention Data: "Counseling: Grief... Navigation: Financial aid, housing, LTC placement".1
               * Cost Driver: "Per Visit Rate".1
               * Trigger: Psychosocial Well-Being CAP.
The dataset highlights "LTC placement applications".1 This suggests COST-SW is heavily utilized at two specific timepoints:
               1. Admission: Crisis intervention/Adjustment to illness.
               2. Discharge/Transition: Navigating the complex Long-Term Care (LTC) application process.
               * AI Pattern Recognition: The model should predict a "U-shaped" utilization curve for Social Work (high at start, low in middle, high at end).
2.6 Dietetics (RD) and Speech-Language (SLP)
               * RD (COST-RD): "Nutrition: Therapeutic diets... tube feeding".1
               * Trigger: Nutrition CAP, Dehydration CAP, Weight Loss.
               * Linkage: COST-RD (Assessment) often triggers COST-MEAL (Logistics - Meal Delivery).1
               * SLP (COST-SLP): "Swallowing: Dysphagia... Communication: Aphasia".1
               * Risk: Dysphagia leads to Aspiration Pneumonia.
               * Logic: IF Swallowing_Difficulty == PRESENT, THEN COST-SLP is a preventive investment to avoid hospitalization.
2.7 Nurse Practitioner (NP): The COST-NP Algorithm
               * Intervention Data: "Advanced Care: Prescribing, diagnosing... to prevent ED visits".1
               * Cost Driver: "Salaried / Hourly".1
               * Source: "Bundle RFS".1
Critical Insight: This is the only clinical discipline funded via "Bundle RFS" rather than "Sched 3". This suggests the NP is a strategic asset used to protect the bundle's margin by preventing ED visits.
               * AI Optimization Goal: Minimize Total Cost of Care.
               * Equation: IF $Probability(ED\_Visit) \times Cost(ED\_Visit) > Cost(NP\_Visit)$, THEN Deploy COST-NP.
               * The AI treats the NP as a "Rapid Response" unit.

3. Personal Support & Daily Living Architecture: The Core Algorithm
The Personal Support Algorithm (PSA) is the engine that calculates the volume of Personal Support Worker (PSW) hours. This is the highest volume cost center in home care. The dataset provides granularity that separates "Personal Care," "Homemaking," and "Delegated Acts," which is essential for accurate modeling.
3.1 Personal Care (The Hygiene & Mobility Vector)
               * Discipline: Personal Care (PSW).
               * Internal Code: COST-PSW.1
               * Interventions: "Hygiene: Bathing, grooming, toileting/incontinence care... Mobility: Transfers (lifts), turning/positioning".1
               * Cost Driver: "Hourly Labour".1
3.1.1 The Time-Task Calculation (PSA Logic)
The "Ontario Personal Support Algorithm" generally functions by summing the standardized times for required tasks. The AI model must replicate this summation.
Table 2: Hypothetical Task-Time Logic for AI Training 1
Task
	Variable Type
	Logic Rule
	Data Trigger (interRAI)
	Bathing
	Frequency
	$Time_{Bath} \times Frequency_{Weekly}$
	ADL Self-Performance (Bathing)
	Toileting
	Frequency
	$Time_{Toilet} \times Frequency_{Daily} \times 7$
	ADL (Toilet Use) + Incontinence
	Transfers
	Frequency
	$Time_{Transfer} \times Frequency_{Daily} \times 7$
	ADL (Transfer)
	Turning
	Duration
	$Time_{Turn} \times (24 / Interval)$
	Bed Mobility = Total Dependence
	3.1.2 The "Lifts" Multiplier
The snippet specifically mentions "Transfers (lifts)".1 In home care logic, the use of a mechanical lift often requires two providers for safety (Two-Person Assist).
               * Logic Gate: IF Transfer_Method == "Mechanical Lift", THEN Staff_Count = 2.
               * Impact: This doubles the cost for the specific duration of the transfer. The AI must account for this scalar multiplier.
3.1.3 Incontinence Logic
"Toileting/incontinence care" 1 is listed. This is a driver for unscheduled or high-frequency visits.
               * MAPLe Connection: Unmanaged incontinence is a strong driver of caregiver distress and institutionalization (high MAPLe).
               * AI Training: The model must recognize that "Incontinence" requires dispersed visits (e.g., 4x daily for 15 mins) rather than block visits (e.g., 1x daily for 1 hour), which significantly impacts scheduling efficiency (travel time).
3.2 Homemaking (The IADL Vector)
               * Discipline: Homemaking.
               * Internal Code: COST-PSW.1
               * Interventions: "Cleaning: Light housekeeping, laundry... Errands: Banking, grocery".1
               * Cost Driver: "Hourly Labour".1
Although the Internal Code (COST-PSW) is identical to Personal Care, the Logic is different. Personal Care is driven by ADLs (Activities of Daily Living), while Homemaking is driven by IADLs (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living).
               * Priority Rule: In resource-constrained scenarios (e.g., budget cuts), Homemaking is typically the first service to be reduced. The AI must assign a lower "Preservation Priority" to Homemaking tasks compared to Personal Care tasks.
               * Substitution Logic: "Grocery shopping assistance" can often be substituted by "Meal Delivery" (COST-MEAL). The AI should compare the cost of COST-PSW (Hourly) vs. COST-MEAL (Per Meal) to find the efficient frontier.
3.3 Delegated Acts (The Task-Shifting Vector)
               * Discipline: Delegated Acts.
               * Internal Code: COST-PSW.1
               * Interventions: "Regulated Tasks: Pre-loaded injections, glucometer testing, suctioning".1
               * Constraint: "Must be taught/delegated by Nurse".1
This is the bridge between Clinical Services and Personal Support.
               * Logic Rule:
IF Task $\in$ {Injection, Glucometer, Suctioning}
AND Patient_Status == Stable
AND Nurse_Delegate == Available
THEN Service_Code = COST-PSW (Delegated)
ELSE Service_Code = COST-NUR.
               * Economic Impact: COST-PSW hourly rates are significantly lower than COST-NUR. Maximizing the utilization of this "Delegated Acts" row is a key objective function for the AI model.
3.4 Respite Care (The Caregiver Vector)
                  * Discipline: Respite Care.
                  * Internal Code: COST-RFS.1
                  * Interventions: "Caregiver Relief: In-home supervision to allow family caregivers a break".1
                  * Source: "Bundle RFS".1
Logic Distinction:
Respite is not driven by the patient's physical needs, but by the caregiver's needs.
                  * Trigger: interRAI Caregiver Distress CAP.
                  * Funding Constraint: Being in "Bundle RFS" implies this is a finite bucket.
                  * AI Training: The input features for this prediction are the "Informal Support" items in the MDS (e.g., Caregiver expresses distress, Caregiver is unable to continue).
                  * Equation: $Respite\_Hours = f(Caregiver\_Distress\_Score, Patient\_Cognitive\_Impairment)$.
________________
4. Safety, Monitoring & Technology Architecture
This category represents the "Digital Health" layer. The AI must view these services as substitutes or compliments to physical labor, used to reduce the frequency of COST-NUR or COST-PSW visits.
4.1 Lifeline (PERS) Logic
                  * Internal Code: COST-PERS.1
                  * Interventions: "Personal Emergency Response System... May include fall detection".1
                  * Cost Driver: "Monthly Subscription".1
                  * Source: "Bundle Q&A".1
Logic Rule:
                  * IF Living_Arrangement == "Alone"
AND (Fall_History > 0 OR Cognitive_Impairment == Moderate)
THEN Allocate COST-PERS.
                  * Cost Benefit: The cost is "Monthly," which is fixed. This is a high-ROI intervention if it prevents even one "Lift Assist" visit.
4.2 Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) Logic
                     * Internal Code: COST-RPM.1
                     * Interventions: "Equipment (tablets, BP cuffs, scales) to track vitals remotely. Includes staff time to monitor alerts".1
                     * Cost Driver: "Device Lease + Software Fee".1
Complex Logic:
The dataset explicitly notes "Includes staff time to monitor alerts." This means COST-RPM is a hybrid of Hardware and Labor.
                     * Target Population: CHF (Congestive Heart Failure) and COPD.
                     * Logic:
                     * IF Diagnosis $\in$ {CHF, COPD}
                     * AND Hospital_Admissions_Last_90_Days > 1
                     * THEN Allocate COST-RPM.
                     * Substitution: If COST-RPM is active, the frequency of COST-NUR (Physical Assessment) can be reduced. The AI must learn this negative correlation: $\Delta RPM \propto - \Delta Nursing\_Visits$.
4.3 Security Checks Logic
                     * Internal Code: COST-SEC.1
                     * Interventions: "Safety Checks. Telephone reassurance or physical safety checks for isolated patients".1
                     * Source: "Bundle RFS".1
Logic:
This is the lowest-acuity safety net.
                     * Trigger: Social Isolation CAP.
                     * Use Case: Patients with mild cognitive impairment living alone who do not need physical care but need "reassurance."
________________
5. Logistics & Access Services Architecture: Social Determinants
The dataset provides a robust menu for addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). These services are critical for the feasibility of the care plan.
5.1 Medical Transportation Logic
                     * Internal Code: COST-TRSPT.1
                     * Interventions: "Patient Transport... Includes local AND out-of-town specialist appointments (no distance cap defined)".1
                     * Cost Driver: "Per Trip / Per Km".1
Risk Analysis for AI:
The phrase "no distance cap defined" 1 introduces significant variance/risk.
                     * Feature Engineering: The AI cannot predict this cost based on clinical data alone. It requires geospatial features:
                     * Patient_Postal_Code
                     * Specialist_Location
                     * Frequency_of_Appointments (e.g., Dialysis = 3x/week).
                     * Budgeting: Since this is in "Bundle Q&A," it is a supportive cost. The AI must accurately forecast this to prevent budget overruns, especially for rural patients.
5.2 In-Home Laboratory Logic
                     * Internal Code: COST-LAB.1
                     * Interventions: "Mobile Lab Services... (OHIP covers test; SPO pays visit fee)".1
                     * Logic:
                     * IF Mobility_Status == "Homebound"
                     * AND Lab_Order == Present
                     * THEN Allocate COST-LAB.
                     * Cost Clarity: The AI is predicting the logistic fee, not the clinical test cost.
5.3 Pharmacy Support Logic
                     * Internal Code: COST-PHAR.1
                     * Interventions: "Delivery fees, blister packing, or medication reconciliation support".1
                     * Logic: "Blister packing" is a safety intervention for memory-impaired patients.
                     * Substitution: COST-PHAR (Blister Pack) is a cheaper alternative to COST-NUR (Med Pouring). The AI should prioritize COST-PHAR if the patient has the physical dexterity to open the pack.
5.4 Specialized Support (Meals, Language, Behavioral)
                     * Language Services (COST-RFS): "Professional translation".1
                     * Logic: IF Primary_Language $\neq$ {English, French}, THEN COST-RFS (Translation) is required for Assessment visits and key Care Planning visits.
                     * Meal Delivery (COST-MEAL): "Meals on Wheels".1
                     * Trigger: Nutrition CAP + IADL (Meal Prep) Impairment.
                     * Behavioral Supports (COST-BEH): "Dementia Care... Specialized support strategies (BSO)".1
                     * Trigger: Behavior CAP (Aggression, Wandering).
                     * Cost: "Hourly (Specialized)." This is likely a higher rate than standard PSW. The AI must distinguish between a "Wandering" patient (needs COST-PSW supervision) and an "Aggressive" patient (needs COST-BEH strategy).

6. Algorithmic Integration: MAPLe, RUG-III, and The "Source" Gate
To function as a cohesive "Ontario Personal Support Algorithm," the AI must weave these individual service threads together using the logic of the classification systems.
6.1 The "Source" Hierarchy Logic
The dataset separates funding into "Sched 3", "Bundle RFS", and "Bundle Q&A". This is the financial "Logic Gate" the AI must respect.
Table 3: Funding Source Logic Rules
Source Code
	Definition
	AI Rule / Constraint
	Included Services
	Sched 3
	Entitlement / Core
	Demand Driven: If clinical criteria are met, service must be provided. Hard constraints.
	Nursing, PT, OT, RT, SW, RD, SLP, PSW (Care/Home/Del).
	Bundle RFS
	Request for Service
	Supply Constraint: Services are discretionary or capped. Optimization target.
	NP, Respite, Security, Lab, Pharmacy, Language, Meals, Social, Behavioral.
	Bundle Q&A
	Quality & Access
	Enabler: Services that enable the care plan to function.
	Lifeline, RPM, Transport.
	Implication: The AI should first calculate the "Sched 3" needs (Clinical + Personal Care). Then, it should look for "Bundle RFS" solutions that might reduce the Sched 3 burden (e.g., using COST-NP to stabilize a patient and reduce COST-NUR hours).
6.2 MAPLe Integration Logic
While the dataset does not contain the MAPLe coefficients, the services listed map directly to MAPLe priority levels.
                     * Low/Mild MAPLe: Algorithm selects primarily from Logistics (COST-MEAL, COST-TRSPT) and Homemaking (COST-PSW).
                     * Moderate MAPLe: Algorithm introduces Personal Care (COST-PSW) and Rehab (COST-PT, COST-OT).
                     * High/Very High MAPLe: Algorithm triggers Nursing (COST-NUR), Behavioral Supports (COST-BEH), and Palliative protocols.
                     * Logic Gate: The AI utilizes the MAPLe score as a "Bias Weight."
                     * IF MAPLe == High, THEN Threshold_for_Approval for COST-NUR is LOWERED.
6.3 RUG-III HC Integration Logic
The Resource Utilization Groups drive the Case Mix Index (CMI). The AI must identify the services in 1 that are "RUG Drivers."
                     * Special Rehabilitation: Driven by COST-PT and COST-OT (specifically the quantity of visits).
                     * Clinically Complex: Driven by COST-NUR (Infusion, Wound Care, Palliative).
                     * Reduced Physical Function: Driven by COST-PSW (ADL scores).

7. AI Training Data Specification and Feature Engineering
To successfully train a machine learning model (e.g., a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Machine) on this logic, the data from BundleComponents.csv must be transformed into a structured schema.
7.1 Input Vector Specification ($X$)
The model requires the following features derived from the clinical assessment:
                     1. Clinical_Triggers: Boolean flags for Wound, IV, Palliative, etc.
                     2. ADL_Scores: Numeric values (0-6) for Bathing, Dressing, Transfer, Toilet.
                     3. IADL_Scores: Numeric values for Housekeeping, Meal Prep.
                     4. Cognitive_Status: CPS Score (Cognitive Performance Scale).
                     5. Caregiver_Status: Presence and Distress level.
                     6. Environmental_Factors: Living alone, rural vs. urban.
7.2 Output Vector Specification ($Y$)
The model predicts a vector of services corresponding to the rows in.1

{
 "prediction_output": {
   "COST-NUR": {
     "probability": 0.85,
     "predicted_sub_type": "Wound Care",
     "predicted_quantity": 4,
     "unit": "Visits/Month",
     "source": "Sched 3"
   },
   "COST-PSW": {
     "probability": 0.99,
     "predicted_sub_type": "Personal Care",
     "predicted_quantity": 12.5,
     "unit": "Hours/Week",
     "source": "Sched 3"
   },
   "COST-RPM": {
     "probability": 0.10,
     "unit": "Lease",
     "source": "Bundle Q&A"
   }
 }
}

7.3 Loss Function Design
The training process must penalize errors differently based on the Source column.1
                     * Safety Penalty: High penalty for False Negatives on COST-NUR (Clinical Risk) or COST-RT (Life Safety).
                     * Budget Penalty: High penalty for False Positives on COST-RFS (Discretionary Spend).
                     * Optimization Reward: Reward the model for selecting "Delegated Acts" (COST-PSW) over "Nursing" (COST-NUR) when the "Stable" criteria are met.

8. Conclusion
The BundleComponents.csv dataset 1 provides a sophisticated framework for home care allocation. It is not merely a price list but a codified logic system that separates entitlement (Schedule 3) from support (Bundle RFS), and clinical necessity (Nursing/Therapy) from logistical enablement (Transport/Meals).
To train an AI model effectively on the Ontario Personal Support Algorithm, one must feed it not just the codes but the context. The model must learn that COST-PSW is not a single service but a spectrum ranging from "cleaning floors" to "suctioning airways" (via delegation). It must understand that COST-PT encompasses both "walking" and "breathing." And most importantly, it must respect the funding silos that dictate the viability of the care plan.
By structuring the training data according to the "Discipline," "Category," "Intervention," and "Source" columns defined in this report, developers can build an AI system that is clinically safe, operationally efficient, and financially compliant with Ontario's home care standards.
